      <div class="text-caption q-mb-md">Last updated: Sep 15, 2025</div>

      <p>
        We respect your privacy. This policy explains what information Deck Verified Games and Deck Settings collects
        and how we use it when you access our website and related services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">What We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect personal information beyond what is automatically provided to our server logs when your
        browser connects to our site. These logs may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="q-ml-lg">
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Browser and device information (user agent)</li>
        <li>Referrer and requested URLs</li>
        <li>Date/time of requests and response status codes</li>
        <li>Basic error details for troubleshooting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We do not run advertising trackers, use third‑party analytics that profile users, or sell your data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">How We Use This Information</h2>
      <ul class="q-ml-lg">
        <li>Operate and secure the site</li>
        <li>Debug reliability and performance issues</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse and investigate incidents</li>
        <li>Understand aggregate usage (non‑identifying)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
      <p>
        We may use cookies or local storage for essential functionality (for example, remembering simple UI
        preferences). We do not use them for advertising or cross‑site tracking.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Third‑Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Contributions and report management may occur on GitHub. When you interact with GitHub, their terms and privacy
        policy apply. Our hosting and CDN providers may also generate their own standard access logs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Server logs are kept for a limited period and then deleted or aggregated. Specific retention times can vary
        depending on operational needs and backup cycles.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Your Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Because we do not maintain user accounts or store profile data, there is typically no personal data for us to
        modify or delete. If you have questions about logs related to your access, contact us and we’ll do our best to
        help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Our site is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the new version here with an updated “Last updated”
        date. Your continued use of the site means you accept the revised policy.
      </p>
