      <div class="text-caption q-mb-md">Last updated: Sep 15, 2025</div>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using Deck Verified Games (the “Service”), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree,
        do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">2. What the Service Does</h2>
      <p>
        Deck Verified Games is a community‑driven resource for sharing device and game compatibility information, performance
        reports, and configuration tips for handheld PCs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">3. Accounts and Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        The Service itself does not provide user accounts or on‑site authentication. Community contributions and report
        management may occur through GitHub. Your use of GitHub is governed by GitHub’s own terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">4. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>When using the Service, you agree not to:</p>
      <ul class="q-ml-lg">
        <li>Post unlawful, abusive, defamatory, or intentionally misleading content</li>
        <li>Infringe others’ rights, including copyrights and trademarks</li>
        <li>Attempt to disrupt, probe, or compromise the Service or its infrastructure</li>
        <li>Spam, flood, or otherwise degrade the experience for others</li>
        <li>Automate access in a way that imposes unreasonable load on our hosting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">5. API and Automated Use</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may expose a public API. We request that you seek permission before heavy or large‑scale use. The
        API is a public resource; fair‑use access is welcome, provided it does not cause significant load or service
        disruption. We may rate‑limit or block abusive traffic to protect service stability.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">6. Content and Licensing</h2>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated, the source code and project materials are made available under the GNU General Public
        License v3.0 (GPL‑3.0). No rights are granted beyond the GPL‑3.0 terms. You are responsible for ensuring your
        use of any code or contributions complies with that license.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">7. Contributions</h2>
      <p>
        By contributing content, you confirm you have the rights to share it and that your contribution does not violate
        others’ rights. Contributions to project repositories are typically accepted under the project’s GPL‑3.0 license
        unless explicitly noted otherwise.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">8. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do
        not guarantee accuracy, reliability, or availability, and third‑party names and marks belong to their respective
        owners.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special,
        exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of data, revenue, or profits, arising from or related to your
        use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">10. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update or change the Service and these Terms from time to time. We will post updates here with a revised
        “Last updated” date. Your continued use of the Service means you accept the changes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">11. Suspension</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or restrict access to protect the Service, comply with law, or address violations of these
        Terms.
