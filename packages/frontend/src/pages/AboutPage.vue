      <h1 class="text-h4 q-mb-sm">About Deck Verified</h1>
      <p>
        Deck Verified is the website companion to <strong>Deck Settings</strong> ‚Äî a community-driven repository of
        game settings, performance tweaks, and compatibility reports for handheld gaming devices like Steam Deck,
        ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and other portable PCs. By sharing reports, you help others optimise performance,
        troubleshoot issues, and build a central knowledge base for handheld gaming.
      </p>

      <!-- Why -->
      <h2 class="text-h6 q-mt-lg q-mb-sm">Why Deck Settings?</h2>
      <p>
        While ProtonDB focuses mainly on Proton compatibility, Deck Settings (and this site) were built to go further.
        Our goal is to create a performance-focused reporting system tailored to handheld PCs, where the quality of the
        experience matters as much as basic compatibility. Reports are structured with specific fields‚Äîtarget framerate,
        TDP limits, GPU clocks, graphics settings, and more‚Äîso that every submission provides practical, repeatable
        data.
        Screenshots and videos can also be attached, making it easier to reference in-game results and compare different
        configurations.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subtitle2 q-mt-md q-mb-xs">1) Editable, user-controlled reports</h3>
      <p>
        You can update or close your own reports without waiting for admin approval. This ensures reports remain
        accurate
        and evolve alongside your testing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subtitle2 q-mt-md q-mb-xs">2) Mobile-friendly reporting and viewing</h3>
      <p>
        Submitting and browsing reports should work smoothly on mobile‚Äîand even directly on the Steam Deck.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subtitle2 q-mt-md q-mb-xs">3) Focus on handheld devices</h3>
      <p>
        Reports are tagged by device type (Deck, Ally, Legion Go, etc.), letting you quickly filter to results that
        match
        your own hardware setup.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subtitle2 q-mt-md q-mb-xs">4) Support for games without Steam App IDs</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike platforms that require Steam App IDs, Deck Settings makes them optional. You can submit performance
        reports for games from Itch.io, GOG, Epic, and even delisted Steam titles.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-subtitle2 q-mt-md q-mb-xs">5) Community discussion and voting</h3>
      <p>
        Reports are published as GitHub issues, where the community can react with üëç to highlight helpful configs and
        add comments with alternative settings, troubleshooting steps, or media for comparison.
      </p>
